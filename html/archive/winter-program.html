        <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          Athemath Winter Program will be an in-person, intensive 2-week program
          that provides math competition training to mathematically gifted
          middle and high school students of a minority gender. Outside of math,
          the program also features a variety of non-math activities, from field
          trips to evening games to holiday parties. Think of it as a summer
          program, just in the winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to foster a community that will help women and non-binary
          people thrive in the long run, in both math contests and the rest of
          the math world. Through the program, students can explore interesting
          problems from the AMC, AIME, and early Olympiad levels, but also
          become part of community of other women and non-binary folk who really
          love math. And virtually of our winter program staff are Mathematical
          Olympiad Program (MOP) alumni and women and nonbinary folk, so
          students will be surrounded by mentors and potential role-models who
          have gone through the same struggles as they have.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year’s program will be held from
          <strong>Saturday, December 18 to Friday, December 31, 2021</strong> at
          <a href="https://www.irvinghouse.com/">Irving House at Harvard</a> in
          Cambridge, MA. The total cost for residential students is $2200 and
          total cost for day-students (who will need to provide their own
          transportation to the program) is $1700. Our application process is
          <strong>need-blind</strong> and students may apply for
          <strong>need-based financial aid</strong> upon acceptance into the
          program. Since the pandemic is very much still ongoing, we have
          established COVID policies that you can read more about in our
          <a href="#covid-faq">COVID-19 FAQ section</a>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="academic">Academic</h2>
        <p>
          The program will feature a total 45 hours of instruction over two
          weeks, which averages out to about 5 hours per academic day. These 45
          hours are split into 18 hours of teaching and 27 hours of hands-on
          problem solving, as we believe that solving lots of problems is the
          most important method of learning mathematics. We also have special
          guest lectures scattered throughout the program, including one from
          <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/">Evan Chen</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All program participants will engage in one course, which will feature
          topics in Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Geometry. The course will
          be taught by our three instructors: Sanjana Das, Pravi Putalapattu,
          and Andrew Wu. Sanjana will cover modular arithmetic, the Euclidean
          Algorithm, divisibility, number-theoretic functions, and orders. Pravi
          will cover constructive, complementary, and casework counting, PIE,
          recursion, bijections, graph theory, and various other smaller topics.
          Andrew will cover angle-chasing, Power of a Point, triangle centers
          and their interplay, and some trigonometry. Staff biographies can be
          found <a href="staff.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="travel">Travel and Safety</h2>
        <p>
          The program will be hosted at
          <a href="https://www.irvinghouse.com/">Irving House at Harvard</a>,
          which is located in Cambridge, MA. Students attending the program will
          need to find transportation to the area, either arriving directly at
          the hotel (e.g. day students who drive or walk) or flying in. In
          particular, students who will be flying will need to fly into
          <strong>Boston Logan Airport (BOS)</strong>, where staff members will
          pick them up and escort them to the hotel. Students will figure out
          and communicate travel plans with program staff in the months leading
          up to the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our program will have a staff to student ratio of at least 1:3, with
          staff members living with the students in Irving House in separate
          rooms. Here are a few policies we will follow to keep participants
          safe:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In case of a medical problem or other emergency, prompt medical
            attention will be administered as required and the student’s parents
            or guardians will be notified as soon as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to the Athemath Winter classrooms and events will be limited
            to Athemath students and staff, and authorized visitors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students are required to attend all classes, during which times they
            will be under direct supervision by Athemath staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students may not leave Irving House at Harvard unless accompanied by
            or given explicit permission to do so by Athemath staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students must remain in their hotel rooms from 11 PM to 7 AM unless
            accompanied by an Athemath staff member.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          With respect to COVID-19, we will have students test prior to arriving
          to the program. More details can be found in the

        </p>
        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Who runs the program?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Virtually all of our staff and teachers are
          <strong>Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) alumni</strong>. This
          means that we’ve been through all the levels of contest math
          experience, including the challenges that gender minorities face at
          each one. Our program staff list includes Andrew Wu and Janabel Xia as
          co-directors, Evan Chen as a residential staff member, and Sanjana Das
          and Pravi Putalapattu as instructors. All staff biographies can be

          to apply. We welcome applications from current middle school and high
          school students. Experience-wise, we are looking to accept students in
          the mid-AMC through mid-AIME level range.
        </p>
        <p class="athered">
          <strong>Q: How many students are admitted to the program?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We will admit about 12 students for the 2021 program cycle.</p>

            >Q: What is Athemath’s policy around vaccination status?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To attend the in-person Winter Program, all students must be
          <strong>fully vaccinated, without exception</strong>. Students will
          provide proof of vaccination during program registration. At Athemath,
          we care about the health and safety of both our students and staff as
          well as the general public. The last thing we want to happen is to
          have someone get COVID-19 and have to quarantine students and/or have
          to send students home early.
        </p>
        <p class="athered">
          <strong
            >Q: So what happens if a student gets COVID during the
            program?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a student believes they may have COVID (e.g. from symptoms), we
          will immediately have that student and all other program participants
          test with an at-home rapid antigen COVID test, and work with the hotel
          to quarantine them in a separate single room with an unshared
          bathroom. We will also quarantine all other students and staff in
          their hotel rooms until the test result is available. If the test
          comes back negative, we will resume the program normally (but we will
          allow any students who wish to continue quarantining to do so). If the
          test comes back positive, we will first and foremost contact the
          student’s guardian on planning the student’s remaining stay - whether
          they would like to go home (if and only if they can have their parents
          drive up), how long they will be quarantined at the hotel, and
          arranging new flights. We will also continue to quarantine and test
          all students and staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we expect the likelihood of getting COVID to be low, as all
          participants will be fully vaccinated.

            program?</strong

        </p>
        <p>
          Students will be required to test prior to flying into Boston Logan
          (BOS) <strong>within 72 hours</strong> of their flight, and email
          their result to program staff as soon as possible. Students who are
          driving to the program are also required to test and email the result
          prior to arriving at the hotel. If possible, we ask that students time
          their test so that their result is available prior to arrival at the
          program.
        </p>
        <p class="athered">

        </p>
        <p>
          We will be testing students following a Monday and Thursday schedule
          throughout the program.
          <strong>Both Walgreens and CVS MinuteClinics</strong> provide COVID
          testing <strong>free of charge</strong> with health insurance (which
          is required of students to attend the program). There are two
          Walgreens with curbside and in-store PCR testing no more than a 12
          minute walk from the hotel. There are also two CVS clinics with quick
          walk-in testing no more than 15-18 minutes from the hotel, and a CVS
          clinic with drive-thru testing no more than 13 minutes from the hotel.
          There are also other various public COVID testing centers around the
          city of Cambridge. Students who wish to get COVID tested outside of
          our testing schedule will be escorted by staff.

          Athemath will be taking the various precautions to reduce the risk of
          COVID transmission for program participants in addition to the regular
          testing schedule. All students and staff will be
          <strong>required to wear a mask</strong> over their nose and mouth at
          all times, unless they are i) in their rooms, ii) actively eating, or
          iii) outdoors in a non-crowded area. We will hold meals in large
          spaces for students to eat socially distanced from each other. In
          addition, the hotel takes various measures to reduce the risk of
          COVID, which are further outlined below.

        <p class="athered">
          <strong>Q: What are the hotel’s policies around COVID?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel at which the program is run, Irving House at Harvard, has
          installed ionizers in all four of the air handlers (one on each floor)
          that supply cooled air throughout the house. These are run twice daily
          throughout the winter months, and potentially more frequently
          depending on the state of the pandemic at the time of the program. The
          hotel also opens windows to freshen the air in guest rooms, which is
          the first thing housekeepers do when they start a cleaning process.
