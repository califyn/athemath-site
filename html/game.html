    <title>Clue #1</title>

   <p>
     Right before you lost it, you were playing a scuffed version of The Game in which there is only one 
     pile, and only one player (yourself). The pile currently contains only the card labeled 1, and you 
     are holding 98 cards labeled 2 through 99. You can place a card on top of the pile if and only if 
     it is either greater OR exactly 10 less than the previous card on top. You need to put all of your 
     cards down. What is the maximum number of times that the number on top can decrease by 10 in the process?

      Let your answer be P. After adding 11 to P, you will get a two-digit number. 
      Go to https://bitpaper.io/go/scavenger%20hunt/IeZIG[]WA where the [] is replaced 
      with this two-digit number.
