        <p>Here is what our students thought of it:</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>
            "Office hours were SO useful, I loved office hours. The TA's (and of course 
            teachers and board members) were all amazing!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Athemath exceeded my expectations by far! Getting to meet and talk with so many 
            awesome people in the math community was an amazing experience, and it's something 
            I've always wanted. Every part of the program was exceptional -- I love how there 
            are so many activities ranging from classes to office hours to clubs. Overall, it's 
            definitely an experience I'll never forget :D."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I already had high expectations for Athemath, seeing as the teachers are all MOPpers, 
            but after taking the Counting Strategies course and attending office hours, I realized 
            that Athemath is by far the best math program I've been a part of. "

        <p>Here is what our students thought of it:</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>
            "I really liked it! I think it helped me improve my geometry skills
            more. The people were really cool and fun to hang out with (both
            students and staff), and they were all really admirable. I had
            something to learn from every one of the people."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Overall, I really liked this program. I learned not only math but
            also other stuff, such as Hanabi, and I think the community is very
            nice and helpful."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The program was fun and informative! It almost felt like a summer
            camp, especially since I hope to keep in touch with the lovely
            people I met through the program!"
          </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't perfect, but it was a good experience for everyone involved
          and we're super excited to iterate and improve in the fall!
