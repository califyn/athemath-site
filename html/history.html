          After a great deal of preparation in the preceding months, our Virtual
          Program pilot, the Spring 2021 session, started in March 2021. Four
          teachers taught our very first courses to twenty students.
        </p>
        <p>Some fun things that happened at Spring '21:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linguistics streams.</li>
          <li>Spontaneous orchestra (the first one).</li>
          <li>The <i>n - 5</i> game.</li>
          <li><i>The Half of It</i>.</li>
          <li>Getting trolled by hard AIME problems.</li>
          <li>Conversations about femininity.</li>
          <li>Gymnastics.</li>
          <li>Folding origami with your feet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is what our students thought of it:</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>
            "I really liked it! I think it helped me improve my geometry skills
            more. The people were really cool and fun to hang out with (both
            students and staff), and they were all really admirable. I had
            something to learn from every one of the people."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Overall, I really liked this program. I learned not only math but
            also other stuff, such as Hanabi, and I think the community is very
            nice and helpful."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The program was fun and informative! It almost felt like a summer
            camp, especially since I hope to keep in touch with the lovely
            people I met through the program!"
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It wasn't perfect, but it was a good experience for everyone involved
          and we're super excited to iterate and improve in the fall!
