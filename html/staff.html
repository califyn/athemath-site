              USAJMO, and was on the 2020 USA European Girls' Math Olympiad
              team, at which she got a silver medal. She started doing math
              contests seriously in seventh grade. While participating in math
              contests, she saw the way in which girls were isolated in math and
              how that helped lead to the under-representation of girls at
              contests. She founded Athemath in 2020 in order to help math girls
              connect to each other. Nowadays, Ali enjoys programming and
              reading webcomics.

              that discourage young girls to continue pursuing math, and hopes
              to provide support for these girls through Athemath. Outside of
              math, she also enjoys dancing / choreographing, studying music,
              and reading.
