She was an Honorable Mention for the 2020 USAJMO, and was on the 2020 USA European Girls' Math Olympiad team, at which she got a silver medal.  She started doing math contests seriously in seventh grade.  While participating in math contests, she saw the way in which girls were isolated in math and how that helped lead to the under-representation of girls at contests.  She founded Athemath in order to help math girls connect to each other.  Other than math, she enjoys playing the piano and programming.</p>
