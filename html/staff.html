              contests seriously in seventh grade. While participating in math
              contests, she saw the way in which girls were isolated in math and
              how that helped lead to the under-representation of girls at
              contests. She founded Athemath in 2020 in order to help math girls
              connect to each other. Nowadays, Ali enjoys programming and
