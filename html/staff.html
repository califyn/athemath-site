              was a two-time MOP qualifier and EGMO gold medalist, and before
              college, she took a gap year to study abroad in South Korea. She

              her free time, she enjoys playing card games, learning languages,
              and going on walks.

              contests seriously in seventh grade. While participating in math
              contests, she saw the way in which girls were isolated in math and
              how that helped lead to the under-representation of girls at
              contests. She founded Athemath in 2020 in order to help math girls
              connect to each other. Nowadays, Ali enjoys programming and
              reading webcomics.

              a perfect score in AMC12. She established GmathIRL and wrote
              Rabbit's Geometry to encourage more participation in STEM fields,
              especially underrepresented genders. She was also an alum of
              Athemath’s first session. Moreover, she is really obsessed with
              EDM and sometimes even remixes different pieces (also 10% DJ) or
              cuts short videos for fun.
