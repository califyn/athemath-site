        <p>
          For many years, women have been underrepresented at the highest levels
          of math contests. There hasn't been a
          <a
            href="https://www.imo-official.org/country_individual_r.aspx?code=USA&column=year&order=desc&gender=filter&nameform=western"
            >female USA IMO team member</a
          >
          since 2007. There hasn't been a female USAMO winner for years, and in
          over 30 years of Mathcounts, there hasn’t ever been
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcounts#National_Champions"
            >a single female Mathcounts champion.</a
          >
          If you pick 30 people at random, the chance that none of them are
          female is less than one in a <i>billion</i>. And on and on and on …
        </p>

        <p>
          What are some problems that face girls? There are many, but Athemath
          is most concerned with the
          <strong>lack of a female math community</strong>. While math itself is
          typically a solitary activity, for many competitors there's an
          intrinsic social aspect of math. We depend on our friends for advice
          on what to study, for motivation to work harder, and for support after
          failures. Math success doesn't happen in a vacuum.
        </p>

        <p>But girls miss out on this.</p>

        <p>
          Most of the time, we're the only girl on our math teams. The only girl
          on the math club. We room alone at all the contests, because there’s
          no other girls on the team to share a dorm with. And being a girl just
          makes it <i>that</i> much harder to be part of the all-male math team
          that’s been together for years, especially at an age that a lot of
          people struggle socially. Moreover, because there’s so few of us,
          we’re bombarded with unwanted attention and rude comments. We don't
          feel like we fit in, or that we belong with the math community, or
          that there's anyone to ask for help or support, and so we start
          dropping out.

        <p>
          We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit incorporated in August of 2020. Our
          founder, Ali Cy,
          <a href="https://www.egmo.org/people/person1751/"
            >represented the US</a
          >
          at the 2020 US European Girls’ Math Olympiad. Athemath began in
          conversations at EGMO about the pervasive lack of girls at higher
          levels of math contests and the specific problems that women in
          contest math faced.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ran our first session from March 2021 to May 2021. In the 2021-2022
          school year, we ran our program twice: once in the fall, and once in
          the spring. To date, over fifty non-binary and female students from
          around the world have congregated virtually in our virtual program for
          twelve weeks of class, community-building events, office hours, and
          casual voice chats. Read about what it's been like
          <a href="history.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our staff is now several people strong, and the vast majority of us
          are math contest enthusiasts united by a desire to help girls reach
          their full mathematical potential. Read more about our staff
