        <p>
          Athemath’s classes will be held in 3-month sessions. Each session will
          have six academic classes and six community-building events (CBEs).
          Academic class weeks and CBE weeks will alternate. Classes will be one
          hour in length, and each CBE will be forty minutes in length.
          Attendance is <strong>required</strong> for both classes and CBEs, and
          being habitually absent will result in removal from the program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Classes will be strictly <strong>virtual</strong> for the 2023-2024
          school-year, and will be held over Zoom. We will also make use of
          tools like Google Classroom and Discord for communication,
          distribution of problem sets, and submission of solutions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

        <p>
          Classes will be taught by female instructors who are distinguished in
          the field of contest math, such as olympiad qualifiers or Math Prize
          for Girls winners. There will be one class every two weeks, which will
          be followed by a handout and problem set for students to work on until
          the next class. Classes will be concluded with a test and Q&A session
          with the instructors. Each class will have five students.
        </p>

        <p>
          To provide assistance for students to work on problems, we’ll provide
          weekly office hours for students to ask questions about the problem
          sets or any other math they’re working on.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the 2023-2024 school year, our classes will be aimed from students
          close to qualifying for AIME up to students who can get a 5 on the
          AIME. They will be focused on one of the four primary contest subjects
          (algebra, number theory, geometry, combinatorics), or on specific
          problem-solving methods. Note that
          <strong
            >our courses are not intended to be a complete curriculum, but to
            supplement existing math practice.</strong
          >
          That doesn’t mean it’s not worth it&mdash;our courses still offer a
          rare opportunity to find mentors who can give students insider advice,
          to find peers and friends among the math community, and provide an
          introduction to solving harder math problems.

        <p>
          Our six CBEs are designed to be enjoyable bonding experiences for
          students and teachers. In order, they are:
