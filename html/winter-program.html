        <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

        <p>Athemath Winter Program will be an intensive 2-week program that provides math competition training to mathematically gifted middle and high school students of a minority gender. Outside of math, the program also features a variety of non-math activities, from field trips to evening games to holiday parties. Think of it as a summer program, just in the winter.</p>

        <p>We aim to foster a community that will help women and non-binary people thrive in the long run, in both math contests and the rest of the math world. Through the program, students can explore interesting problems from the AMC, AIME, and early Olympiad levels, but also become part of community of other women and non-binary folk who really love math. And virtually of our winter program staff are Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) alumni and women and nonbinary folk, so students will be surrounded by mentors and potential role-models who have gone through the same struggles as they have.  </p>

        <p> This year’s program will be held from <strong>Saturday, December 18 to Friday, December 31, 2021</strong>. The total cost for residential students is $2200 and total cost for day-students (who will need to provide their own transportation to the program) is $1700. Program participants and staff will be housed in <a href="https://www.irvinghouse.com/">Irving House at Harvard</a>. Since the pandemic is very much still ongoing, we have established COVID policies that you can read more about in our <a href="#faq">FAQ section</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="faq">General FAQ</h2>
        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: When is the Athemath Winter Program?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Saturday, December 18</strong> to <strong>Friday, December 31,</strong> which consists of two full weekends and two full weeks.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Where will the program be held this year?</strong></p>
        <p>The city of <strong>Cambridge, MA</strong>. Students and staff will all stay at the <a href="https://www.irvinghouse.com">Irving House at Harvard</a> hotel.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Who runs the program?</strong></p>
        <p>Virtually all of our staff and teachers are <strong>Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) alumni</strong>, so we’ve been through all the levels of contest math experience (including the challenges that gender minorities face at each one).</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: How do I apply?</strong></p>
        <p>The application form can be found <a href="https://athemath.org/apply">here</a>. The application consists of your basic demographic information, any contest scores you wish to report, a few short essay questions, and a <a href="../uploads/admissions/winter21.pdf">qualifying exam</a>. The application deadline for the 2021 program cycle is <strong>October 13th, 2021</strong>.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: How many students are admitted to the program?</strong></p>
        <p>We will admit about 12 students for the 2021 program cycle.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Who is eligible to apply?</strong></p>
        <p>You must be <strong>between 13 and 17 years of age</strong> inclusive by December 18, 2021 to apply. We welcome applications from current middle school and high school students. We are looking to accept students in the mid-AMC through mid-AIME level range. </p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: How much does the program cost?</strong></p>
        <p>The program costs $2200 for students staying overnight at the hotel, and $1700 for day-students. However, students may apply for need-based financial aid if they are unable to afford the cost of the program. More information on financial aid can be found here.</p>

        <h2 id="covid-faq">COVID-19 FAQ</h2>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: What is Athemath’s policy around vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p> To attend the in-person Winter Program, all students must be <strong>fully vaccinated without exception</strong>. Students will provide proof of vaccination during program registration. At Athemath, we care about the health and safety of both our students and staff as well as the general public. The last thing we want to happen is to have someone get COVID-19 and have to quarantine students and/or have to send students home early.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: So what happens if a student gets COVID during the program?</strong></p>
        <p>Once a student believes they may have COVID (e.g. from symptoms), we will immediately have that student tested at a local COVID-testing center and work with the hotel to quarantine them in a separate single room with an unshared bathroom. We will also quarantine all other students and staff in their hotel rooms until the test result is available. If the test comes back negative, we will resume the program normally (but we will allow any students who wish to continue quarantining to do so). If the test comes back positive, we will first and foremost contact the student’s guardian on planning the student’s remaining stay - whether they would like to go home (if and only if they can have their parents drive up), how long they will be quarantined at the hotel, and arranging new flights. We will also continue to quarantine and test all students and staff.  However, we expect the likelihood of getting COVID to be low, as all participants will be fully vaccinated.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Will students need to get tested before coming to the program?</strong></p>
        <p>Students will be required to test prior to flying into Boston Logan (BOS) within <strong>72 hours</strong> of their flight, and email their result to program staff as soon as possible. Students who are driving to the program are also required to test and email the result prior to arriving at the hotel. If possible, we ask that students time their test so that their result is available prior to arrival at the program.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Will students have access to COVID testing throughout the program?</strong></p>
        <p>Local CVS MinuteClinics provide COVID testing free of charge with health insurance (which is required of students to attend the program). There are two CVS clinics with quick walk-in testing no more than 18 minutes from the hotel, and a CVS clinic with drive-thru testing no more than 13 minutes from the hotel. There are also other various public COVID testing centers around the city of Cambridge. Students who wish to get COVID tested will be escorted by staff.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: Is it safe to send my child to the Athemath Winter Program?</strong></p>
        <p>Athemath will be taking the various precautions to reduce the risk of COVID transmission for program participants. All students and staff will be <strong>required to wear a mask</strong> over their nose and mouth at all times, unless they are i) in their rooms, ii) actively eating, or iii) outdoors in a non-crowded area. We will hold meals in large spaces for students to eat socially distanced from each other. In addition, the hotel takes various measures to reduce the risk of COVID, which are further outlined below.</p>

        <p class="athered"><strong>Q: What are the hotel’s policies around COVID?</strong></p>
        <p>The hotel at which the program is run, Irving House at Harvard, has installed ionizers in all four of the air handlers (one on each floor) that supply cooled air throughout the house. These are run twice daily throughout the winter months, and potentially more frequently depending on the state of the pandemic at the time of the program. The hotel also opens windows to freshen the air in guest rooms, which is the first thing housekeepers do when they start a cleaning process.</p>
