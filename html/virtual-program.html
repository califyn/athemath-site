        <h2 id="whats-included">What's Included</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to think of the virtual program is like a math summer
          camp, but virtual, at 25% intensity, and during the school year. It's
          much more than just the math class you go to every two weeks; we have
          <a href="#clubs">clubs</a>, <a href="#office-hours">office hours</a>,
          and even <a href="#classes">individual check-ins</a> with your
          teachers. Not just a math class—full package included. Each session is
          twelve weeks; the program runs once in the fall and once in the spring
          each school year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to take full advantage of the program, we estimate Athemath
          to be a <strong>2-3 hour/week time commitment</strong>. But the caveat
          here is that if you're already spending that much time working on math
          on your own, a lot of Athemath activities will get absorbed into your
          regular math schedule. That is, Athemath isn't <i>extra</i> work on
          top of your individual math work: it's supplemental and helps support
          you while you work on math on your own. On the other hand, if you
          aren't that into math but want to be, attending Athemath and getting
          roped into our events will be a great way for you to keep yourself
          accountable to your practice schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our only mandatory events are classes, check-ins, and clubs, if you
          choose to join one, because we understand that many people have busy
          schedules during the school year. Our other events are optional, but
          <i>optional</i> does not mean <i>skip</i>. When asked what advice
          they'd give to an incoming student, the most common was: "Go to the
          events!" If you won't take it from our mouths, here is word for word
          what alumni have wrote:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <p>
            <strong
              >If you were to give one piece of advice to a new student entering
              Athemath, what would it be?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            "Please please please don't be too shy, you're wasting a great
            opportunity. If you decide to always turn off your video, not come
            to any events, and isolate yourself, you aren't going to make any
            friends."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I would tell new students to be active! Especially on the discord
            because there's so many amazing people willing to meet you."
          </p>
          <p>
            "If I were to give one piece of advice it would probably to not be
            afraid to ask questions, and to attend more office hours sessions
            than I did. All the staff and peers will gladly answer any questions
            about anything."
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          There's several more, but hopefully this is enough to make the point.

        </p>
        <h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
        <p>
          The core of the Virtual Program is a six-lesson series of classes
          taught by one of our teachers over Zoom. Each class lasts for one hour
          and comes with a optional 10-problem problem set; class happens every
          odd week (i.e. once every two weeks) on Saturday afternoon. Each class
          has around five students; some classes may have four or six students.
          Depending on the number of applicants we get this year, we may relax
          the restriction that each student is only allowed to take one class.
        </p>
        <p>
          We plan to run eight to ten different classes per session this year.
          Classes typically either concentrate on a single topic or are "topics"
          classes where the teacher selects some of their favorite topics to
          present. (See <a href="catalog/catalog-2.html">here</a> for some
          classes that ran in the Spring '23 session.) Topics span mid-AMC to
          early olympiad level. When you apply, you'll select the classes you
          want to take; on our end, class placement is done through a
          combination of factors including your preference, skill level match,
          whether you've been to Athemath before, and to some extent, other
          people's placement. We do not place students exclusively based on
          skill level, because skill level is both ambiguous and changes much
          faster than most people suspect, and also because many classes will
          work for a wide range of skill levels.
        </p>
        <img
          class="text-img"
          src="../uploads/class.png"
          alt="Picture of an ongoing AtheMath class during the Virtual Program"
        />
        <p>
          The coolest part about Athemath classes is that each is taught by a
          recent nonbinary or female Math Olympiad Program alumni who designs
          the course from scratch (see <a href="staff.html">staff</a>). They're
          a free (well, only <a href="#payment">$90</a>) role model! Not only do
          they bring deep math experience to the table, but they're also
          intimately familiar with the modern math contest scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to classes on odd weeks, you will also have a bi-weekly
          individual check-in with your teacher at the same time on even weeks.
          This is a great opportunity to get to know them a little more, and for
          them to help you along on your math journey.
        </p>
        <h3 id="clubs">Clubs</h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone in Athemath has the same interests, and that's okay. Get
          to know your fellow peers in a small group setting with your TA by
          participating in weekly events through a club. Our club-leading TAs
          each pick something they're interested in, whether it be international
          math contests or Taylor Swift, and you can join a club (or even
          multiple clubs) simply by signing up at the beginning of the session.
        </p>
        <h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
        <p>
          As explained in <a href="#what-do">What We Do</a>, our first and
          foremost goal is to help support you while you do individual math
          practice outside of Athemath. Many of us often wished we had someone
          to ask guiltlessly for solutions to hard problems we couldn't solve.
          For Athemath students, you have office hours—scheduled time every week
          where one of our TAs comes and helps answer any math questions you
          have. Both problems you're doing outside of Athemath, and problems
          you're doing for the class problem sets are allowed. It's really
          relaxed and pretty fun—a bunch of students come without any questions
          to ask and are given some on the spot by TAs as a sort of supervised
          problem-solving session.
        </p>
        <h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>
        <p>
          Coffee is a way to get to know the staff, as they host low-key,
          spontaneous conversations over Discord voice chat.
        </p>
        <h3 id="cbe">CBE</h3>
        <p>
          CBE is just one hour of optional social time with your Athemath peers,
          doing some fun activity together, while Athemath staff try to make you
          actually talk to each other. (CBE stands for
          <i>community building event</i>, which is kind of a bad name, but
          we're running with it.) Zero expectations, zero requirements, just fun
          (ideally). What more could you ask for? If you want to know what kind
          of events happen at CBE, here are some CBEs that will probably happen
          this year:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Peer Interview</li>
          <li>Puzzles</li>
          <li>Powerpoint Karaoke</li>
          <li>Sculpture</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="discord-lounge">Discord Lounge</h3>
        <p>
          A bunch of events, random conversations, and announcements happen in
          our <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> server. Discord is
          software that provides a virtual lounge with text, voice, and video
          options, as well as dedicated channels for different topic
          discussions. It's become really popular because it works really well
          for nearly any program, be it a virtual summer camp or problem-writing
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Discord lounge lets you talk to your peers and Athemath staff
          24/7, as a way to keep the community in touch. If you have math
          questions, or want to discuss a recent contest, or just talk about
          life, Discord is open for you to discuss.
        </p>
        <h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
        <p>Our classes have a class fee of $90 per twelve-week session.</p>
        <h3 id="our-financial-aid-program">Our financial aid program</h3>
        <p>
          Our need-based financial aid program lets select students take
          Athemath courses for free, thanks to the generosity of our sponsors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested, indicate so in your application, and we'll
          follow up with more details. We don't ask for any information other
          than household income and any large expenses that you feel may be
          relevant; it's very simple, and historically applicants who ask for it
          can get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do ask that if $90 is not a substantial amount for your household,
          though, please don't ask. We try our best to minimize costs and to use
          the money where it is most needed, we don't profit from our
          operations, and your course fee helps keeps us afloat.
        </p>
        <h3 id="why-not-free">Why not free?</h3>
        <p>
          Many student-led math courses online are free. Athemath is not, for
          three reasons:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-indent: 0px">
          <li>
            We need money to cover costs. In order to attract the best
            instructors and to cover the costs of Zoom, drawing tablets, web
            hosting, etc., we need money and your class fee helps us stay
            afloat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paid courses have higher commitment. Massive open online courses
            (MOOCs) have something like
            <a
              class="athered"
              href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals"
            >
              15 times higher retention</a
            >
            among people who pay. We've put a lot of love and care into our
            program, and we need your commitment to make it work.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lot of great, free math resources are already available. What
            makes Athemath different isn't math instruction, it's the people—and
            people aren't free.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All of our income goes towards paying instructors and covering costs.
          As organizers, we don't profit from class fees and donations.
        </p>
        <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
        <h3 id="what-do">What we do</h3>
        <p>
          Our main goal is to help ambitious but isolated nonbinary and female
          members of the math community. A lot of successful mathletes have a
          few things in common: a rich math community surrounding them that can
          provide support; personal connections to older, successful mathletes;
          ability to participate in college math contests throughout the year;
          intense drive to practice math on their own; genuine love of math. We
          try to cultivate each of these in our students.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that you tend to become like the people you surround
          yourself with. Athemath surrounds students with other motivated
          students as well as older, accomplished mathletes. Many of our
          students are from isolated geographic regions or despite having a
          local math community, are isolated because of their gender. Through
          Athemath, they start to get to know successful female or nonbinary
          mathletes, and are immersed in math-contest culture.

          Unlike most programs, Athemath is intended to be a supplement to
          individual practice. We like to think ourselves as a booster for your
          regular math practice. We trust our students to be able to figure out
          what practice works best for them, and to take advantage of our
          resources as they need, which is also why most of our events are
          <i>optional but strongly recommended</i>. Along with that, we try to
          put our students in contact with other programs, courses, camps, and
          competitions that we feel may benefit them. We even provide
          <a href="scholarships.html">travel scholarships</a> for students to
          attend contests during the school year.

          Historically, a lot of the most successful math tutors often waste
          their math expertise on unmotivated students with zealous parents,
          making the distribution of teaching resources vastly inefficient.
          Athemath also helps connect the best young teachers with the best
          young students, and to use the limited time they have most
          effectively. We try to use their time as efficiently as possible,
          because they are also often still preparing for their own olympiads
          and contests. And the Virtual Program even helps our teachers connect
          with each other virtually during the school year, because the problems
          of gender-rooted isolation aren't only exclusive to our students.

          The most important thing we look for in a prospective Athemath student
          is that you either are or want to be really into math contests.
          Ideally, you already practice math on your own. You might not have a
          lot of friends who do math, but doing well on next year's contests is
          really important to you. Math <i>should</i> be your most important
          extracurricular activity. Also, you should be either nonbinary or
          female.

          For actual ability requirements, we take students ranging from scores
          of 90 on the AMC 10 to 7-9 on the AIME. Students lower than this range
          may want to try reading
          <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store"
            >AoPS's introductory book series</a
          >. Students higher than this range may want to try
          <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html">OTIS</a>, if they are
          looking for more structure in their math practice and a math
          community. We prefer students who are in grades 6-9 in the 2023-2024
          school year. Older students have historically felt "too old", while
          younger students felt "too young". However, if you feel like you will
          be okay with this age group, apply, as we may still accept you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do prioritize student groups underrepresented in the contest space,
          including minority races and ethnicities in math contests, average or
          low-income (less than $75,000 annual income) households, LGBTQ
          students (note: we do not accept male-identifying students), students
          with non-traditional family structures, and students from isolated
          geographical regions or schools without a strong math contest
          presence, because these students are the ones who need our help the
          most. If you are a member of any one of these groups, please apply!
        </p>

          Athemath usually has quite a few international students, and we're
          eager to support math students from all countries. However, if you are
          an international student and considering applying, keep in mind that
          Athemath all-student events will run between 7pm-10pm Eastern Time,
          and so it would be ideal that you are available during that time.

          Our application consists of a couple essay questions and an admissions
          quiz with around five problems. See the top of this page for when
          applications for the Fall and Spring sessions will open.

          For returners, the most important criteria we use is your history of
          attendance at prior sessions. If you went to office hours, clubs, and
          other optional events, plus are still a good fit grade/level-wise, we
          will probably accept you.
